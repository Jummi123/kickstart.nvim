### Using kickstart in termux

BASH script allows you to manually install packages for mason.

## How to
```
pkg install which
```
# Download script

# Make executable
```
chmod +x pkg-install-mason
```
# Install Clangd for example
```
./pkg-install-mason clangd
```

Script is mostly from https://github.com/Amirulmuuminin/setup-mason-for-termux.
I just added a way to automatically install clangd, since itâ€™s not a standalone package in Termux.
It comes with clang.
